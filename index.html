					<h1>How does stuff get online?</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						There was a time, long ago, when you had to hand code HTML to get
						anything online. Fortunately, programmers who didn't want to do
						this anymore created tools to make things easier. Some of these
						tools are programmer-oriented, to make web development easier
						for folks who are already coding, but some of these take writing
						any code by hand out of the equation almost entirely.

					<h2>Content Management System</h2>
					<p>e.g. Wordpress, Drupal, SquareSpace, etc.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						These systems fall under the umbrella of content management
						systems. Unsurprisingly, it's a system to help you manage your
						content on the web. What that means in practice is that it's the
						system that creates a structure around your content, your text,
						images, videos, etc., allowing you to pick a setup once, and then
						only focus on your content, and not the presentation around it.
					</aside>

					<aside class="notes">
						A content management system is a piece of infrastructure, like a
						building to house your content, in that it's a structure around
						your content. The structure was created for some purpose, and as
						such, it has different pieces of infrastructure to make certain
						things easier. Also like a building, content management systems
						exist in the context of different communities, which informs how
						things develop for the system itself. The original purpose of a
						CMS, just like the original purpose of a building, doesn't always
						define its current use. WordPress started as a blogging platform,
						and still does that quite well, but it has evolved into a
						platform used for all kinds of websites, from company pages to
						e-commerce sites. When you're looking for a way to put
						information on the web, you want to look at the structures that a
						system has to help you do stuff, and at the community of people
						surrounding it, to see if it's a neighborhood of people with
						similar or converging goals for their content.

					<i class="fal fa-university fa-10x"></i>
					<aside class="notes">
						Omeka and Scalar both come along with assumptions about the kinds
						of content that they will manage. They both come from
						universities, with Omeka coming out of George Mason and Scalar
						coming out of USC. Their backgrounds and goals inform how they
						approach content in slightly different ways.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h1>Omeka</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's start by talking about Omeka. It was developed at George
						Mason, and its name is a Swahili word meaning "to display or lay
						out wares; to speak out; to spread out; to unpack". It comes from
						a library, archive, and museum context, so it has a heavy focus
						on collections of various kinds of things, although it tries its
						best to be agnostic about what kinds of things it collects. This
						collections focus predisposes it towards metadata and
						organizational tools, with collections content being deeply
						integrated into its narrative features. Basically, Omeka assumes
						that you have a bunch of stuff, that you care a lot about how
						that stuff is described, and that you want to tell stories about
						that stuff. It can work for projects for which these assumptions
						are not true, but those are its biases.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Omeka Examples</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						So let's talk about some examples of how Omeka has been used in a
						classroom setting.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/hist1610-essay.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Using Omeka as a home for student essays is a very easy way to
						shake up the traditional research essay. Students can write a
						fairly traditional essay in Microsoft Word or whatever they like,
						and then copy and paste the essay into an Omeka exhibit. It's a
						very easy process, but it can re-contextualize the essay from
						something that only the student and their professor and/or TF
						will ever read to something that exists out in the world with a
						wider potential audience. It also opens the door for the use of
						images or other multimedia additions to the essay, which can be a
						tremendous help in essays like this one on Japanese traditional
						pottery with deep Korean roots.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/hist1039-gallery.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Another way to use Omeka in the classroom is to use its focus on
						collections of things as a platform to base other assignments off
						of. In this class, First Empires: Power and Propaganda in the
						Ancient World, the instructor curated this collection of objects
						for the students.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/hist1039-item.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						The students were given some basic information about the object,
						which they then had to use as the basis for their research into
						the object, and what meaning canbe derived from it.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/hist1039-essay.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						These essays also live in the Omeka site, where they can
						incorporate other images and multimedia elements, and also
						include direct connections to those original objects.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/hist1039-map.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A side benefit of using Omeka, from this same class, is that once
						students are already working in the system, they can make use of
						the additional functionality of its plugins, should they choose.
						This student used the Neatline mapping plugin to plot out
						differing interpretations of this eighth campaign of Sargon the
						second. What would be a somewhat ugly image in a traditional
						journal is here an interactive experience, where the audience can
						dig deep into the modern day terrain and see the relationship of
						the text describing the place to the varying interpretations of
						place.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/anth1130-items.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Of course, Omeka can be used to collect descriptions of things, a
						use very much in line with its original purpose. This is from the
						archaeology of harvard yard, where students dig up the yard in
						search of its secrets. Here they've collected what they've found
						with quite a bit of context and narrative. What you can't see,
						because the collection is private, is that there are nearly two
						thousand other objects described by the students. These
						descriptions aren't public-ready, but they have served as a great
						way to collect metadata about the objects as part of accessioning
						them in to the museum's collection system.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<!-- <section data-background-image="img/battersea.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color="#000">
					<aside class="notes">
						Here is a very different looking Omeka site, one which is still
						using the same platform, but which looks very different.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/battersea-item.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color="#000">
					<aside class="notes">
						You can see that the site is still very much a museum-like
						experience, in that it collects a variety of things together with
						some descriptions and other metadata, but everything else has
						changed pretty dramatically. Now, come with me as I stretch the
						limits of that building metaphor. There's a show that I watch on
						Netflix about people who are building their own homes in various
						interesting ways. (Trust me, this is going somewhere).
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/house-old.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color="#000">
					<aside class="notes">
						One couple bought a rather dull mid-century brick square of a
						home, and, without fully demolishing it, built up this beautiful,
						modern home with great glass windows overlooking a nearby park.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/house-new.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color="#000">
					<aside class="notes">
						But underneath the walls of that new, beautiful house are still
						the bones of the building; that brick structure is still there
						beneath the surface.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="img/battersea.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color="#000">
					<aside class="notes">
						That's basically what's been done in the case of the Battersea
						arts archive, the bones of the architecture have been preserved,
						underneath a fairly extensive facelift. In this case, the core
						structure is a way of thinking about content and information that
						focuses on collections of items, and putting them together into
						galleries and narratives. The point that I want to make here is
						that there is this potential separation of aesthetic and function
						that you can undertake with some elbow grease and/or funding for
						a front-end developer who works with PHP.

					<aside class="notes">
						In Omeka, as in a museum, there's a space for people to wander
						around and explore things, and there's a "backstage", where the
						magic happens. What you find at that url on the screen is the
						public, front-facing part of the website. Now, let's go back
						stage and see how some of it works. You should be able to access
						that backend through the "Login" link in the nav bar, using your
						Harvard Key credentials. If not, raise your hand and let us know!
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="img/omeka-backend.png" alt="A screenshot of the admin interface of an Omeka website">
					<aside class="notes">
						I just want to give you a quick tour of the interface back here
						before we get into some core functionality. You have this top
						bar, which has site administration options. You're seeing those
						because we've given you full access to the site, so you can see
						what it's like to administer your own Omeka site. On the left,
						you have different kinds of content to edit. This section will be
						visible to everyone, although people with limited access may not
						have all of the options. There are roles that can only view
						content, roles that can only create their own content, roles that
						can manage all content, and the role that can do whatever it
						wants (that's you today!).

					<h1>Items in Omeka</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Items are the things that you will collect on your site. I'm
						being intentionally vague with my vocabulary, because you could
						just as easily have a collection of buildings as you could a
						collection of paintings or photographs. Anything that you might
						care to represent digitally can be accommodated, since all you
						need is a bit of metadata.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Dublin Core</h2>
					<table style="font-size:26pt">
						<tr>
							<td>Title</td>
							<td>Subject</td>
							<td>Description</td>
							<td>Creator</td>

							<td>Relation</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>

							<td>Coverage</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<aside class="notes">
						In order to have a setup that can accommodate any kind of "thing"
						while still having some degree of specificity and
						interoperability in the metadata used, Omeka uses a metadata
						standard called Dublin Core. You see here all of the metadata
						elements that are included in the standard. There are	15 of them,
						and none of them are required to create an item. Title and
						description are used frequently by Omeka, though, so it's a good
						idea to include them. Otherwise, you have a collection of 15
						buckets that are general enough for you to put in whatever
						information you'd like. This generality makes it easier to use
						Omeka for any kind of material, because you aren't stuck with
						"author" or "artist", but instead the more general "creator",
						that can encompass both.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="img/files.png" alt="Screenshot of back-end page to add files to Omeka item">
					<aside class="notes">
						Files are also an important part of an Omeka item. Any file type
						can be added to an Omeka item, as long as the site's security
						settings have been set up to allow it. Only certain image, video
						and audio formats will be rendered on the page, all other formats
						will simply be downloadable.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Collections in Omeka</h2>
					<p>Think boxes of items, described with the same Dublin Core metadata</p>
					<p>Items can't go in multiple collections</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Colllections are like boxes in an archive. They expect to have a logic to them, a reason to collect them in the same place. Because of this assumption, they have their own Dublin Core metadata that can be assigned. Also, Items can't be placed in multiple collections. They are like physical boxes, in that you can't put the same thing in two different boxes. For a less archival way of associating Items with each other, Omeka also offers a basic tagging system, with fewer descriptions and fewer restrictions.
					</aside>

					<h1>Your turn</h1>
					<p>harvardartmuseums.org</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now let's make an item or two. Go to harvardartmuseums.org, and check out a current exhibition. Take a look at the items in the collection, find one you like (there are more than seven, just use the arrows to scroll through), and then add it to the Omeka site, with as much metadata and imagery as you care to add.

					<h1>Exhibits in Omeka</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Okay, let's move on to another core part of Omeka, the exhibit.

				<section>
					<i class="fal fa-book-heart fa-10x"></i>
					<aside class="notes">
						Exhibits are the narratives at the heart of an Omeka site. The items are fascinating on their own, but the exhibits pull together these materials into a narrative, and use them to substantiate that narrative.

							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Here's a bit about the structure of an Exhibit. At the top, you have the whole exhibit, which gets its own base url, which usually contains the exhibit's description. Beneath that, we have individual exhibit pages, which also get their own urls. These are the sections of an exhibit, which can be navigated through at the will of the reader. Finally, making up the pages, are the actual blocks of content. These are the bits of styled content, whether they're images, text, or other kinds of content blocks added by plugins. They don't get their own urls, because they're part of each page. You might have a page with some text, an image, and then a gallery of images, or you might have a page that's just a block of text; you can have as many or as few as you like.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Your turn (again)</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						The best way to cement that idea of how exhibits work is to try it out for yourself. Take your item and put it in an exhibit, with a bit of text about why you chose it to bring in to the site. Go nuts if you want to, but start there.

				<h1>Omeka's Extra Features</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					There are some additional features of Omeka, added through plugins, which I'll go over now.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<h1>Neatline</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Neatline is a plugin that lets you create interactive maps, annotated however you like to create a narrative.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Student-created map</h2>
					<a href="http://hist1039-16.omeka.fas.harvard.edu/neatline/fullscreen/the-eighth-campaign-of-sargon-ii" target="_blank"><img src="img/hist1039-map.png" alt="screenshot of an interactive map of the middle east"></a>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's take a closer look at the map that that student created. We can zoom in and see the different paths, but on the right, we can also look through a translated narrative, annotated with links to the places described. You can also hover over each line, and see the name of the scholar who proposed that route for Sargon the second.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-iframe="http://beautifulspaces.omeka.fas.harvard.edu/neatline/fullscreen/coastal" data-background-interactive>
					<aside class="notes">
						Here is another map, but you might notice that this one looks a little different. It's not a modern map, and it's not superimposed on the modern landscape, it's just an annotated image. You can do this with any image, making Neatline a viable annotation platform as well. It's worth mentioning that Neatline can do a lot, but it has a kind of clunky interface. It's still one of the best interfaces for creating quick and easy non-linear narrative maps, but that's because there's nothing particularly satisfying out there.

					<h1>IIIF Toolkit</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						The IIIF Toolkit allows you to re-use images from other image hosting systems, like the library here or the Harvard Art Museums.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/International_Image_Interoperability_Framework_logo.png" alt="IIIF Logo">
					<aside class="notes">
						So IIIF stands for the International Image Interoperability Framework, and basically its a pretty technical standard for transmitting images. It makes it so that different repositories can speak the same, quite expressive language about their image content. In practical terms, this means that you don't have to re-host images, and you get some really great tiling that allows for zooming, panning, slicing and dicing of images. So not only is it easier to take advantage of the high quality images in archival repositories, but you also get some great features too.

						Interactive media form the cornerstone of the modern web. Scalar is a free, open source authoring and publishing platform that’s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online.

						Scalar enables users to assemble media from multiple sources and juxtapose them with their own writing in a variety of ways, with minimal technical expertise required. Scalar also gives authors tools to structure essay- and book-length works in ways that take advantage of the unique capabilities of digital writing, including nested, recursive, and non-linear formats.

						Scalar vs Omeka

						Omeka:
						- Digital items with well-defined metadata
						- Organizing things into collections or exhibits
						- Crowdsourcing (Scripto)
						- Mapping (Neatline)
						- Users: instructors, archivists, librarians, museums

						Scalar
						- Longform, multimedia-rich writing
						- Less about organizing things, more about writing; it's more flexible overall, not just item-exhibit model
						- Annotation of media (video, audio, or images)
						- Use media from many locations
						- Unique paths through content
						- Basic mapping, timelines

					<ul style="font-size:0.7em;">
						<li>Scalar Book: “Harvard in the Public Sphere”</li>
						<li>Find a partner and pick a person from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harvard_University_people">the Wikipedia "List of Harvard University People"</a></li>
						<li>Each pair will produce a Scalar path for a Harvard alumni</li>
						<li>Guidelines
							<ul>
								<li>The path should add Dublin Core metadata (dc:date and dc:spatial) on the path page for the figure’s</li> birthdate and birthplace
								<li>The path should use tags on the path page for the figure’s occupation(s)</li>
								<li>The path should include at least 3 pages, and at least one of the pages should use a layout other than  “Basic”</li>
								<li>The path should include at least 4 pieces of media (of at least two different kinds, eg photo and video)</li>
								<li>The path will include at least one Scalar widget (Timeline, Map, Tag or Path visualization)</li>
								<li>The path will be added to the larger path and the Table of Contents</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Explore the book</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Take three minutes to look at the work of other teams</li>
						<li>With a partner:
							<ul>
								<li>Did other teams take different approaches to constructing paths?</li>
								<li>What works well in Scalar?</li>
								<li>What is less successful?</li>
